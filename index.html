                            Philippe Coutinho Correia (born 12 June 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who
                            plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Spanish club Barcelona and the Brazil
                            national team. He is known for his combination of vision, passing, dribbling and ability to
                            conjure curving long-range strikes.[4]

                            Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Coutinho showed prodigious talent and excelled in Vasco
                            da Gama's youth system. He was signed by Italian club Inter Milan in 2008 for €4 million and
                            subsequently loaned back to Vasco, where he became a key player. He made his debut for Inter
                            Milan in 2010, and was later loaned to La Liga club Espanyol in 2012. In January 2013,
                            Coutinho joined English club Liverpool for £8.5 million. He flourished at Liverpool, being
                            named in the PFA Team of the Year in 2015.[5][6] In January 2018, Coutinho signed for
                            Barcelona for a club record fee reportedly worth €160 million (making him the world's second
                            most expensive player at the time),[7] and won two La Liga titles. However, he was loaned to
                            German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan ahead of the 2019–20 season, being a part of
                            the team that won a treble including the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and UEFA Champions League.[8]

                            Kevin De Bruyne (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a
                            midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City, where he is vice-captain, and the
                            Belgium national team. He is one of just three players (the others being Cristiano Ronaldo
                            and Thierry Henry) to have won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award back to back, and
                            the only midfielder and Belgium player to have done so in English football history.[5]

                            De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the 2010–11
                            Belgian Pro League. In 2012, he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and
                            then loaned to Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in 2014, where he
                            established himself as one of the best players in the Bundesliga and was integral in the
                            club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win. In the summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a
                            club record £54 million. He has since won three Premier League titles, five League Cups and
                            an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, he had a significant role in Manchester City's record
                            in becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In
                            2019–20, De Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a Premier League season and was
                            awarded Player of the Season.</p>

                            either a winger or attacking midfielder.

                            Di María began his career with Rosario Central, but came into prominence at Benfica after
                            signing for the club in 2007, aged 19. He helped Benfica win a Primeira Liga championship,
                            the club's first in five years, and two Taça da Liga titles. In 2010, Di María moved to
                            Spanish club Real Madrid in a transfer worth €25 million, where he won a La Liga title and
                            the UEFA Champions League. He subsequently signed for Manchester United in 2014 in a
                            then-British record deal worth £59.7 million (€75.6 million), but left a year later to join

                            all-time leader in assists.

                            Di María made his senior international debut for Argentina in 2008 at age 20, and has since

                            a striker for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and captains the England national team.
                            Regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, Kane is known for his prolific
                            goalscoring record and ability to link play.[4][5]

                            Born and raised in the London borough of Waltham Forest, Kane began his career at Tottenham
                            Hotspur, where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, he was promoted to
                            the senior team in 2009, at age 16. He did not initially feature for the side, and was

                            Orient, Millwall, Leicester City, and Norwich City. Kane's involvement at Tottenham began to
                            increase following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach in 2014. In his first
                            full season at the club, Kane scored 31 goals across all competitions, was the Premier
                            League's second-highest goalscorer, and was named PFA Young Player of the Year.

                            In the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons, Kane finished as the league's top goalscorer. In the
                            latter campaign, he helped Tottenham finish as the competition's runners-up and won the PFA
                            Fans' Player of the Year award. Kane registered his best campaign statistically to date in
                            the 2017–18 season, with 41 goals scored in 48 games across all competitions, and in the
                            following season, he finished as a runner-up in the UEFA Champions League. In February 2021,
                            he became Tottenham's second-highest all-time goalscorer in official competitions. He ended
                            the 2020–21 season as the top goalscorer and top assist provider in the league.</p>

                        <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo-Details:</h3>
                        <p class="overflow">
                            Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP,
                            before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first
                            season. He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions
                            League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was
                            the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real
                            Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies,
                            including two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, four Champions Leagues, and became the
                            club's all-time top goalscorer. He also finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times,
                            behind Lionel Messi – his perceived career rival – and won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013
                            and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Ronaldo signed for Juventus in a transfer
                            worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club
                            and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles,
                            two Suppercoppas Italiana, and a Coppa Italia in his first three seasons with the club.

                        <p class="overflow">
                            Lionel Messi was born in Santa Fe Province on 24 June 1987. At the age of five, he started
                            playing football for Grandoli, a club coached by his father. In 1995, Messi switched to
                            Newell's Old Boys. At the age of 11, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency.

                <p>France won the match 4–2, having taken a 2–1 lead during the first half on an own goal and penalty
                    awarded by the video assistant referee (VAR), both firsts in a World Cup final. France became the
                    second team in the 32-team World Cup era to win all their knockout matches in regulation time, after
                    Brazil in 2002. The final was the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966,[4] and the
                    highest-scoring 90-minute final since 1958.[5] </p>
